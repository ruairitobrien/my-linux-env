My Linux Env
============

This is a repository of my own linux configuration files.

# Why?

It's a pain having to setup a new Linux environment. I have had to do it many times for various reasons and this repo is an attempt to reduce that pain in future. Also it's good to keep a record of interesting configs I have come across.

# How this works

It's basically all [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797](here) but documenting in a little more detail for future me here.

## First Time

This is how to do this first time ever i.e. you are on a machine with a config and you want to start tracking that config. Not use an existing one.

```bash
# Initialize a bare repo in a directory called .cfg
git init --bare ~/.cfg

```
